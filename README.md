# MyRobotProject

Python bindings for the MyRobotProject C++ library.

This project is a Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), and Release pipeline tailored for robotics applications. It's deliberately a modular monorepo to make sure it's maintanable and easy to understand. The project is still under active development, but the following sequence outlines the end-to-end flow we want a developer to achieve:

1. Development: A developer pushes a commit to a feature branch or opens a pull request against the main branch.
2. CI Trigger: This action automatically triggers the CI workflow on GitHub Actions.
3. Matrix Build: The CI workflow initiates a matrix of parallel jobs, building and testing the code across multiple configurations (e.g., Linux and Windows operating systems, Debug and Release build types).
4. Dependency Resolution: Each job fetches and installs the necessary external dependencies, such as the MuJoCo physics simulator and testing frameworks.
5. Compilation: The project is compiled using the CMake build system.
6. C++ Unit Testing: A suite of C++ unit tests, written using the GoogleTest framework, is executed to validate the core logic of individual components.
7. Python Integration Testing: Python tests, run via pytest, are executed to validate the correctness of the pybind11 bindings and any pure Python logic. This ensures the C++ and Python layers are correctly integrated.
8. Quality Gates: Static analysis and code formatting checks are run to enforce code quality and style consistency.
9. Release Trigger: Upon successful integration into the main branch, a developer creates a versioned Git tag (e.g., v1.0.0) to signify a release.
10. Release Workflow: The creation of this tag automatically triggers a separate Release workflow.
11. Python Packaging: The workflow builds a Python wheel package, which includes the compiled C++ extension module. This package is then published to the Python Package Index (PyPI).
12. C++ Artifact Packaging: The workflow also packages the compiled C++ libraries, executables, and public header files into an archive (.zip or .tar.gz). This archive is attached to the corresponding GitHub Release, making the native components available for C++ developers.


I intend to try this on a (still private) research project I'm working. Testing surgical simulation on environments generated by general purpose world models (e.g. Genie). This will help me iterate and ultimately refine this project.
